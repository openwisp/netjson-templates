# NetJSON Templates

NetJSON is a data interchange format based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) designed to describe the basic building blocks of layer2 and layer3 networks. OpenWISP uses NetJSON to create configurations. If you have devices with very similar configuration dictionaries you can store the shared blocks in one or more reusable templates which will be used as a base to build the final configuration.

*TL;DR*: OpenWISP configurations can be simplified with the help of reusable templates written in NetJSON.
